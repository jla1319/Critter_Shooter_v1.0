Critter_Shooter_v1.0
====================

HTML5 game created with Lee Ezell with javascript and canvas. I worked on the particle-like movements
for the rabbits and cats, as well as 90% of the game art. My partner for this project, Lee Ezell,
worked on the player and enemy movement and the game art for the player.

Made at RIT during the 2012-2013 school year during spring semester.


HOW TO PLAY

============

Use the left and right arrows to move around.
Hold the x or y keys to shoot either cats or rabbits.
